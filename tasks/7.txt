Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.

db.employees.aggregate([		
    { $lookup: {		
        from: "employees",		
        localField: "ReportsTo",		
        foreignField: "EmployeeID",		
        as: "ReportsToQ"		
    }},		
    { $unwind: {path: "$ReportsToQ", preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true}},		
    {$project: {
        _id:false,
        EmployeeID: 1,
        FullName: { $concat: [{ $ifNull: ["$FirstName", ""]}, " ", { $ifNull: ["$LastName", ""]}] },
        ReportsTo: { $ifNull: [ {$concat: ["$ReportsToQ.FirstName"," ", "$ReportsToQ.LastName"]}, "-" ]}
    }}		
]);
